  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The main goal of teaching voters to tell fact from fiction in this presidential election is composed of the following TWO sub-targets: 1) develop the habit of using fact-checking websites,
    2) have empathy for other people who could be socially, financially and culturally different from the voters themselves in order to understand contexts behind people’s decision-making process.
</p>
  <p>

    That is, in order to achieve the goal of teaching voters to tell fact from fiction in the next presidential election, each sub-target is a requisite piece of the larger objective. The learning target will be achieved if/when learners can identify misstatements by the candidates.
    In order to successfully teach this topic, let’s revisit the following THREE major content pieces.
  </p>
  <div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title">Content 1 → Play back a video of Donald Trump Rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida on August 10, 2016</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body" style="text-align: center">
      <p>
        Firstly, why don’t we play back a video where he once again attributed the rise of ISIS to President Obama’s troop withdrawal in 2011 and claimed President Obama is the founder of ISIS and Hillary Clinton is the co-founder.

        Let's do the quiz and see whether you could detect Mr. Trump's misstatements in the video.

        Secondly, thru the next content, we could sort of understand why Mrs. Clinton lost because voters cannot trust her. On October 28, 2016, at a press conference to respond to potential re-opening of the investigation into her private email server practice dubbed #EmailGate, Mrs. Clinton wrongly said FBI director James Comey sent letter about emails 'only' to Republicans in Congress.

      <p>
        The letter was also addressed to ranking democrats in Congress. Why don’t we do a quiz to find out how familiar you are with our congressional members?
        Once you figure out who’s who, I do want to help you make informed decision going forward.

        Finally, our last content will reflect the fact that the election last night has really taught us that the country has become further divided and polarized. In order for our union to become perfect again, each one of you must learn how to have empathy for people who could be socially, financially and culturally different from yourselves as you do fact-checking.

      <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/62acdd911e4d44a5b855acf25122bd22/obama-administration-confirms-double-digit-premium-hikes">Show Associated Press’ reporting on October 24, 2016</a></h2>
      <p>
        News media definitely has a role in the campaigns. Do you happen to remember on October 24, 2016 that Associated Press has a headline that read, “Obama administration confirms double-digit premium hikes”? I hate to point out that was misleading and devils were in the details, i.e. context is important. Poor people seem to have benefited greatly from Obamacare, but some other families were suffering financially. Thru the following two quizzes, you could see Obamacare actually means different things to different people.

        Donald Trump has repeatedly said Obamacare is “disastrous” and he would repeal and replace if elected. By electing Mr. Trump on Nov 8, does that mean voters are sending a message that they do not care that much about their fellow Americans who cannot afford health insurance once their wallets shrink? This is a question worth exploring in the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election.
